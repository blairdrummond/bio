This is a package designed to extract information on the stochastic properties of single molecules. It was originally designed for dwell time analysis of single channel data derived from patch clamp experiments. It contains functions for importing and exporting idealized stochastic events, as well as for displaying, analyzing and sorting dwells.

# `.evt`s and `.dwt`s

EVTs (Event files) and DWTs (Dwell times) are formats produced and required by several pieces of software that are used by the lab. In particular, TAC produces and uses `.evt` files and Mill uses `.dwt`s. So we need to read and write these files often, but they aren't ideal ways to represent our data, and so the only manipulations we want to do on `evt`s and `dwt`s is read and write them to data-types which are more natural in R. Those data-types which we prefer are **segments**, and **bursts**, which are detailed in the next sections. Segments are essentially tables of dwell times, and bursts are essentially lists of segments, but with meta-data attached to them. In any case **the first thing you want to do is convert your file into a list of segments**.

## Handling `.evt`s

In the case of `evt` files, when reading in, files transition through three states:

$$ \tt{evt\ file} \to \tt{Table\ of\ transition\ times} \to \tt{Table\ of\ dwells} $$

So that in order to read an `evt` file, we must do something like

```{r, fig.show='hold', eval=FALSE, include = TRUE}
# Load the library
library(scbursts)

infile <- "data/100uM.evt"

# Import the evt as a table
transitions <- evt.read(infile)

# Turn the transition times into dwells
dwells <- evt.to_dwells(transitions)

# With dwells defined, we can start doing an actual analysis
```

Writing to `evt`s **is not symmetrical** with reading them, as the dwell times are automatically converted to transition times.

$$  \tt{Table\ of\ dwells} \to \tt{evt\ file} $$

so that to write an `evt` you simply have to write

```{r, fig.show='hold', eval=FALSE, include = TRUE}
# Write the corrected transition times to disk.
evt.write(dwells_corrected, file="100uMc.evt")
```

## Handling `.dwt`s

`dwt`s are lists of dwell times, and so they convert to **segments** and **bursts** very naturally. To read and write, we simply write


```{r, fig.show='hold', eval=FALSE, include = TRUE}
dwells <- dwt.read("60uM.dwt")

# ...
# 
# Correct the dwells or do an analysis
# 
# ...

dwt.write(corrected_dwells, file="60uMc.dwt")
```

# Segments

`.dwt` files record sequences of dwells, which alternate between open and closed states (at least, they should. Though this sometimes there are errors. This will be discussed later). There can be multiple "segments" of dwells

```
Segment: 1   Dwells: 4181
	1	0.000150
	0	0.000900
	1	0.078490
	0	1.910400
	1	0.421490
.
.
.
	0	1.334670
	1	0.012270
Segment: 2   Dwells: 7653
	1	0.065900
	0	0.596160
	1	0.849920
	0	0.023830
	1	0.612380
	0	0.022120
.
.
.
```

**segments** are the direct analog of this, but in R. They are individual stretches of dwells of open and closed states. We often have to deal with **lists of bursts**, such as when we read a `dwt` file (which usually has multiple segments).


```{r, fig.show='hold', eval=TRUE, include = TRUE}
# Load the library
library(scbursts)

# Import a pre-packaged file (stored inside the folder extdata)
dwt_example <- system.file("extdata", "example.dwt", package = "scbursts")

# Import the evt as a table
dwells <- dwt.read(dwt_example)

# Just transition times and states
head(dwells[[1]])
```

There are a number of different functions which act on segments, and that's why they're useful. The functions that one can use on segments start with `segment.`, *some* of the available functions are:


|        Function         |    Description                    |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `segment.open_dwells`   | Extract open   dwells as a vector |
| `segment.closed_dwells` | Extract closed dwells as a vector |
| `segment.count_open`    | Count number of openings          |
| `segment.count_closed`  | Count number of closed            |
| `segment.popen`         | Empirical P(Open) for interval    |
| `segment.pclosed`       | Empirical P(Closed) for interval  |
| `segment.duration`      | Total segment duration            |
| `segment.verify`        | Is the segment error free?        |

While these can be used on a single segment, it's more likely that one will want to use these in conjunction with `bursts.select` in order to select a segments that have some property that is of interest. For instance, one can use these to isolate and analyze bursts with a high $P(Open)$. More on this in the next section.

# Bursts

In the program, a **segment** is used to denote any contiguous sequence of dwells (plus some metadata); but a recording usually contains multiple segments, and the segments themselves usually (after analysis) contain many **bursts** seperated by long close times. This motivates us to talk about **lists of segments** often, and since these are often **bursts**, the functions that deal with lists of segments are lumped under functions that apply to bursts.

Since, `evt` recordings do not detect bursts, but also have multiple segments, one usually has to pass a recording into some burst detector, in order to isolate the bursts individually. So, for example, a function like `bursts.defined_by_tcrit` splits several segments (the segments from the recording) into multiple smaller segments (the bursts).


```{r, fig.show='hold', eval=TRUE, include = TRUE}
# Load the library
library(scbursts)

# Import a pre-packaged file (stored inside the folder extdata)
infile <- system.file("extdata", "example.evt", package = "scbursts")


# Import the evt as a table
tables <- evt.read(infile)

# Turn the transition times into dwells
records <- evt.to_dwells(tables)

# Correct the risetime (default time in seconds)
records_c <- risetime.correct_gaussian(Tr=35.0052278,records, unit="us")

length(records_c)

# Define critical time (tcrit=0.1s)
bursts <- bursts.defined_by_tcrit(records_c , 0.1, units="ms")

length(bursts)

## Now you can carry out analysis of the bursts
```

Turning a list of recorded segments into a single list of bursts will lose some information about which original segment the bursts belonged to, and the program will issue a warning to let you know this. This will be discussed a bit more in the section on writing bursts back to disk.

There are a few things that we might be interested in doing to bursts.

### Taking a subset

We might not always be interested in all the bursts, but perhaps bursts that have some characteristic, such as a high *P(Open)*. So, rather than using the full list, we might want to extract a few bursts. The question is, "how would we do that?" and the answer is, combine the functions we have for **segments** and `bursts.select`.


```{r, fig.show='hold', eval=TRUE, include = TRUE}
# Load the library
library(scbursts)

# Import a pre-packaged file (stored inside the folder extdata)
infile <- system.file("extdata", "example.evt", package = "scbursts")


# Import the evt as a table
tables <- evt.read(infile)
records <- evt.to_dwells(tables)

# Correct the risetime (default time in seconds)
records_c <- risetime.correct_gaussian(Tr=35.0052278,records, unit="us")

# Define critical time (tcrit=0.1s)
bursts <- bursts.defined_by_tcrit(records_c , 0.1, units="ms")

high_popen <- function (seg) {
    segment.popen(seg) > 0.7
}

high_bursts <- bursts.select(bursts, high_popen)
```

This will return a list of bursts which you can work on, and you can remove more bursts as you wish until you have what you're looking for. If you want to extract bursts and write them to file (for instance, for processing by MILL), you can use the line

```{r, fig.show='hold', eval=FALSE, include = TRUE}
high_bursts <- bursts.select(bursts, high_popen, one_file=TRUE)
```

and this will extract the high P(Open) bursts **as a single segment**, which can then be written to a single `dwt` file. The advantage of using this trick, is that this particular function can write the bursts to a single segment **and preserve the amount of time that actually took place between the bursts**. In order to do this manually, you have to use `bursts.recombine`.

### A Special Case (Correcting Recording Errors)

As a specific example, when using actual recorded data, there are sometimes errors where multiple openings or closings are recorded in succession

```
Segment: 1   Dwells: 4181
	1	0.000150
	0	0.000900
	1	0.078490
	1	0.078490
	1	0.078490
	0	1.910400
	1	0.421490
	0	1.896120
.
.
.
```

this is obviously physically impossible, but sometimes appears in the data. To correct this, one would seperate the recording into bursts (as usual) and then remove the burst where the error occurred.


```{r, fig.show='hold', eval=FALSE, include = TRUE}
library(scbursts)
infile <- "faulty_dwells.dwt"

# This will raise a warning message to alert you that the data has problems
dwells <- dwt.read(infile)

dwells_c <- risetime.correct_gaussian(Tr=0.0000350052278,dwells)

# This will also raise a warning message to alert you that specific bursts have problems
bursts <- bursts.defined_by_tcrit(dwells_c,0.1)

# This will remove the problems. It will leave only the good bursts.
bursts <- bursts.select(bursts, segment.verify)
```

In a related problem, sometimes one might want to discard the first and last burst, as you might now know whether or not you began recording in the middle of a burst (so the depiction of burst behaviour would be innaccurate). You can fix this with `bursts.remove_first_and_last`.

## Writing bursts back to files

We mentioned that we could take a segment, split it into bursts, remove some bursts, and then write back to file. We mentioned a short-cut to do this, but also that this could be done manually. This requires the use of `bursts.recombine`. The tool isn't trivial, because it preserves the elapsed time between the bursts when rejoining them. But, we also mentioned that recordings could contain multiple segments, but what was not emphasised was that this means that **we usually have no idea how much time transpires between segments**. However, despite this, there are times where we want to merge all bursts as though they were occurring in one segment. For this reason, **we need a function to artifically insert gaps between bursts**. We often use these in conjunction, with something like


```{r, fig.show='hold', eval=TRUE, include = TRUE}
# If you have multiple records, you can recombine them with
# This is now just one list of spaced out segments.
records <- bursts.space_out(records, sep_factor=1000)
record <- bursts.recombine(records)
```

There are scenarios wheere this is probably the most natural way to create a single segment with all the data you're interested in. If you are interested in playing around with the spacing between bursts (for example, the closings that exceeded a critical time), you can also look at `bursts.get_gaps` which extracts this information as a vector.

## Sorting and more

In addition to taking a subset of bursts according to some criteria, one might want to sort bursts according to some metric, or simply get tabulated values of some metric. For example, what is the average P(Open) across all bursts? Or what do the bursts look like when we rank them by P(Open)?

Sorting is implemented by `bursts.sort`. It requires only a metric on segments - a function which takes a segment and gives you a number.

```{r, eval=TRUE, include = TRUE}
# Create a list of bursts, sorted by your chosen function
sorted <- bursts.sort(bursts, segment.popen, reverse=TRUE)

# In some cases, it might be that multiple bursts share the same value
# and so the "order" is a bit arbitrary in those cases.
sorted[[1]]
```

as for collecting data on all bursts, `bursts.popens` and `bursts.pcloseds` have been provided for convenience, and so you could get the average with


```{r, eval=TRUE, include = TRUE}
mean(bursts.popens(bursts))
```

But, it isn't hard to write your own functions that do this. The definition of `bursts.popens` is simply

```{r, eval=FALSE, include = TRUE}
bursts.popens <- function (bursts) { sapply(bursts, segment.popen) }
```

You can simply use `sapply` in an analogous way with any function that deals with a single segment. For instance, you could find the average duration with

```{r, eval=TRUE, include = TRUE}
mean(sapply(bursts, segment.duration))
```



## Working with bursts v.s. segments

Most important functions can be applied either to a single segment, or to a list of segments. For instance, the following two are equivalent:

```{r, fig.show='hold', eval=TRUE, include = TRUE}
# Correct the risetime

corrected_records <- list()
for (i in 1:length(records)) {
    corrected_records[[i]] <- risetime.correct_gaussian(Tr=35.0052278, records[[i]], units="us")
}

# Write the corrected record to a .dwt file
dwt.write(corrected_records, file="60uMc.dwt")
```

and this simplified code

```{r, fig.show='hold', eval=TRUE, include = TRUE}
# Correct the risetime
records_c <- risetime.correct_gaussian(Tr=35.0052278, records, units="us")

# Write the corrected record to a .dwt file
dwt.write(records_c, file="60uMc.dwt")
```

but this is not always true, and not every function can be made to work on either. You may have to write your own functions, use for loops, or use `sapply` (or `lapply`) in order to do everything that you want to do. 


# Risetime Correction

It was skimmed over, but risetime correction on the recordings can be accomplished simply with

```{r, fig.show='hold', eval=TRUE, include = TRUE}
# Load the library
library(scbursts)

# Import a pre-packaged file (stored inside the folder extdata)
infile <- system.file("extdata", "example.evt", package = "scbursts")


# Import the evt as a table
tables <- evt.read(infile)

# Turn the transition times into dwells
records <- evt.to_dwells(tables)

# Correct the risetime (default time in seconds)
records_c <- risetime.correct_gaussian(Tr=35.0052278,records, unit="us")

evt.write(records_c, file="example_corrected.evt")
```

As the name of the function suggests, the current risetime correction attempts to undo the effects of a guassian filter. This method might not be optimal, and may be replaced later. For a more detailed explanation, see section 4.1.1 of Colquhoun and Sigworth, "Fitting and Analysis of Single-Channel segments".
