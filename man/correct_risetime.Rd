\title{Undo the effect of the guassian filter
See section 4.1.1 of Colquhoun and Sigworth,
"Fitting and Analysis of Single-Channel records"}
\usage{
correct_risetime(Tr, table)
}
\arguments{
\item{Tr}{Rise time of the filter in (us)}

\item{table}{table with $states and $dwells to correct.}
}
\value{
Table with corrected risetimes.
}
\description{
NOTE: This is potentially problematic, in that this unfiltering
lengthens every state. A less na√Øve algorithm would take into
account the infulence of the surroundings, as they impact the
effects of the filter.

table <- correct_risetime(14.77155587, table)
