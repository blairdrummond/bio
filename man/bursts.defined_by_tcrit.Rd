\title{Split segment at long pauses, dividing the segment
into multiple -shorter- segments (which are the bursts),
Along with the interburst closings, which are referred to as "gaps".}

\item{segment}{Segment with $states and $dwells}

bursts. Which is a list of segments
starting and ending in 1 states (open dwell)

Split segment at long pauses, dividing the segment

bursts <- bursts.defined_by_tcrit(record_c , 0.1)

# Note that you need two brackets to access list elements.
# Also note that each burst begins and ends with an open dwell
# The gaps seperating them are the elements of gaps.
