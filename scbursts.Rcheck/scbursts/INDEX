bursts.defined_by_tcrit
                        Divide a recording into bursts defined by a
                        critical time.
bursts.get_gaps         Get the gaps between bursts.
bursts.pcloseds         Return pcloseds of every burst.
bursts.popens           Return popens of every burst.
bursts.recombine        Combine bursts into one recording (with obvious
                        spaces between them).
bursts.remove_first_and_last
                        Remove the first and last burst from the list.
bursts.select           From a list of bursts, extract those that
                        interest you by passing a selecting function.
bursts.sort             Order a list of bursts by some function. For
                        instance, popen.
bursts.space_out        Artificially add amount of time between bursts
                        (in absence of recording information).
bursts.start_times_update
                        (DON'T USE THIS) Fix meta-data of bursts.
cplot.log_root_axes     Add log-root axes to histogram plot
cplot.pclosed_ts        Plot Time Series (ts) of P(Closed).
cplot.popen_ts          Plot Time Series (ts) of P(Open).
dwt.read                Read a .dwt file.
dwt.write               Write a dwt file to disk. Writes DOS line
                        endings. Dwells are in milliseconds
evt.extract_header      Extract header from evt file.
evt.from_dwells         Converts dwell durations to absolute transition
                        times.
evt.read                Read a .evt file to a table. Times are in
                        seconds
evt.to_dwells           Calculate pulse lengths. Converts transition
                        times to dwell durations.
evt.write               Write bursts to a .evt file.
hst.extract_header      Extract header from hst file.
hst.read                Read a MIL ".hst" file to a table.
hst.write               Write bursts to a log10(ms)-sqrt(Frequency)
                        .hst file from open and closed tables.
risetime.correct_gaussian
                        Undo the effect of the gaussian filter.
scan.read               Read a scan results text file. scan.read
                        returns a 1 segment dataframe. Reads in scan
                        results and puts them in the same format as the
                        output of dwt.read. See 'dwt', and 'segment'
                        for more information.
segment.closed_dwells   Extract closed dwells.
segment.count_closed    Extract number of closed dwells.
segment.count_dwells    Extract number of dwells in segment.
segment.count_open      Extract number of open dwells.
segment.create          Create a "segment" object
segment.duration        Get duration of a segment.
segment.name            Extract name from segment.
segment.open_dwells     Extract open dwells.
segment.pclosed         Calculate empirical P(Closed) of a segment.
segment.popen           Calculate empirical P(Open) of a segment.
segment.seg             Extract segment number from segment.
segment.start_time      Extract start_time from segment.
segment.verify          Detect misrecorded data.
util.basename           Remove suffix and path from filename.
