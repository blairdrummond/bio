# UOttawa Ion Channel Analysis

This `R` Package was designed for use by the [dacosta lab](http://www.dacosta.net/). The package contains the following features:

- Transform data between formats (`.evt`, `.dwt`, etc)
- Correct for effects of the Gaussian filter on the time-series data.
- Identify bursts in time series, and isolate those bursts.
- Provide toolkit for sorting, filtering, and studying individual bursts.
- **Tentatively** Burst detection.

If any features seem wrongfully absent, or if any methods can be improved upon, feel free to either create an [issue](https://github.com/blairdrummond/bio/issues) or (even better) submit a pull request.
