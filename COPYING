SCBURSTS LICENSING
==================

scbursts is licensed under the GNU Lesser general public license v2.1 or later. See the LICENSE file. Scbursts has included dependencies with different licenses, as is detailed in the section EXTERNAL LIBRARIES. The LGPLv2.1 is forward compatible with later LGPL or GPL licenses, which apply to some dependencies, and the MPL2 which applies primarily to the eigen3 library is permissive, and so its use in the LGPLv2 project is permitted. 

Scbursts was authored by Blair Drummond; Mathieu Dextraze is a contributor.
